# Ivy for Bitcoin Cash

Ivy is a higher-level language that allows you to write smart contracts for the Bitcoin Cash protocol. It can compile to instructions for Bitcoin Cashâ€™s virtual machine, Bitcoin Cash Script, and can be used to create  Bitcoin Cash addresses.

You can try out Ivy using the [Ivy Playground for Bitcoin](https://ivy.copernet.io), which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, all in a sandboxed environment.

You can learn more about Ivy and using the Ivy Playground for Bitcoin Cash by reading the [docs](https://ivy.copernet.io/docs).

**Ivy is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use Ivy to control real BitcoinCash.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome; you can create an [issue](https://github.com/copernet/ivybch/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/copernet/ivybch/pulls) on this repo.
