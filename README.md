# Ivy for BitcoinCash

Ivy is a higher-level language that allows you to write smart contracts for the BitcoinCash protocol. It can compile to instructions for BitcoinCashâ€™s virtual machine, BitcoinCash Script, and can be used to create  BitcoinCash addresses.

You can try out Ivy using the [Ivy Playground for BitcoinCash](https://ivy.copernet.io), which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, all in a sandboxed environment.

You can learn more about Ivy and using the Ivy Playground for BitcoinCash by reading the [docs](https://ivy.copernet.io/docs).

**Ivy is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use Ivy to control real BitcoinCash.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome; you can create an [issue](https://github.com/copernet/ivybch/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/copernet/ivybch/pulls) on this repo.
